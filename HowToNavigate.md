This page is a WIP but feel free to use it

## What is Gravinium

[About Page](https://about.gravinium.org)

Gravinium (`gruh-VIN-ee-um`) is the name that we, [Nighthawk](https://team.gravinium.org?nighthawk) and [Chrome](https://team.gravinium.org?chrome), use for all the projects and groups we manage together.

## Where to find everything we do

As we expand to work on more project, we'll put them all on our website, [gravinium.org](https://gravinium.org).
There, you'll be able to find our groups, worlds, and any other projects we eventually publish.

## How to get involved

You can find all our socials on our about page, but if you'd like more direct interaction with us and the rest of the community, you can join the [discord](https://discord.gravinium.org).

You can also join our VRChat groups to hang out with us in-game (we like randomly hanging out so def join up)
